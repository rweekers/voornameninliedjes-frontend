  "background":"\"A Boy Named Sue\" is a song written by Shel Silverstein that was made popular by Johnny Cash. Cash was at the height of his popularity when he recorded the song live at California's San Quentin State Prison at a concert on February 24, 1969. The concert was filmed by Granada Television for later television broadcast. The audio of the concert was later released on Cash's At San Quentin album. Cash also performed the song (with comical variations on the original performance) in December 1969 at Madison Square Garden. The song became Cash's biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and his only top ten single there, spending three weeks at #2 in 1969, held out of the top spot by \"Honky Tonk Women\" by The Rolling Stones. The track also topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts that same year and was certified Gold on August 14, 1969 by the RIAA.\n\nShel Silverstein's recording was released the same year as \"Boy Named Sue\", a single to the album Boy Named Sue (and His Other Country Songs), produced by Chet Atkins and Felton Jarvis. <i>(thanks to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_Named_Sue\">Wikipedia</a>)</i>",
